====================================
Diffusion 7-point Stencil Benchmarks
====================================

Benchmarks
----------

- baseline
  - A baseline sequential implementation
- openmp
  - OpenMP-parallel version of baseline
- mic (not completed)
  - Intel MIC version
- cuda 
  - NVIDIA CUDA version
  - Several variants available (e.g., cuda_opt1)
- opencl (not completed)
  - Portable OpenCL version

Compilation
-----------

Type `make'. By default, diffusion3d_baseline and diffusion3d_openmp
will be built. Other variants can be built with `make
variant-name'. For example, the CUDA variant can be built `make cuda'
if the CUDA toolkit is available.


Usage
-----

Execute each benchmark as: 

   benchmark_executable [--count N] [--size S]

The options can be used to set benchmark configurations. For more
information, see the help message by supplying --help option.


Notes
-----
- File diffusion3d.mic.c
  - deprecated
- File diffusion3d_mic.cc
  - not tested
  - needs PCI timing. see diffusion3d.mic.c
